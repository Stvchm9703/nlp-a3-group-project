# CoNLL-2003 NER Model Comparison Report

## Introduction
This report aims to compare the performance of various NER models on the CoNLL-2003 dataset. The following models were evaluated: BiLSTM-CRF, Transformers (e.g., BERT), SpaCy, AllenNLP, and Flair.

## Metrics Evaluated
- Accuracy
- Precision
- Recall
- F1 Score
- Training Time
- Resource Requirements
- Robustness to Domain Variability
- Ease of Use and Integration
- Customization Flexibility
- Model Size and Footprint

## Methodology
- Each model was trained and evaluated on the CoNLL-2003 dataset using standardized procedures.
- Metrics were calculated to assess the performance of each model.
- Qualitative aspects such as ease of use and integration were also considered.

## Results
- Detailed results for each model across all evaluated metrics.

## Conclusion
- Summary of findings and recommendations based on the comparison.

## Future Work
- Suggestions for further research or improvements in NER model evaluation.
